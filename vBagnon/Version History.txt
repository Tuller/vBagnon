vBagnon Version History, in the format YY.MM.DD

6.11.24
	Initial Release
	
6.11.24b
	Fixed an issue preventing the Ammo category from working
	Fixed an issue causing slots to sometimes become invalid, I think
	
	Made search windows properly size
	Simplified the defaults for the inventory frame
	
6.11.26
	Reverted to all in one views for the bag and bank frames.
	Clicking on a tab determines if the contents of that tab are viewable or not. 
	Dragging a tab off of the frame will create a temporary frame showing all the contents of that tab.
	
6.12.01
	Category groups are back
	Tabs are now placed within the frame
	/findr is no longer case sensitive
	/find accepts multiple args, separated by a comma, as well as !arg. For example, /find <name1>, <name2>, !<name3> is equivalent to (<name1> and <name2> and not <name3>)
	Search windows will again separate categories based on if items are in your bank or not, if searching at the bank.
	I should have fixed the bug preventing the addon for properly loading due to players not having the same amount of bag slots as myself
	When a frame only has a single category, the tab frame is hidden
	Item filtering by hovering over a bag/tab works looks like it did in Bagnon_Spot
	Added more spacing between two categories on the same row
	Added empty slot and item counts to tab tooltips
