# vBagnon

vBagnon is failed v2 of Bagnon. The v part of v Bagnon was due to it implementing virtual windows of your inventory, each tied to a search query. 
Those virtual windows could be combined into a single window, or broken out into separate displays.

What I basically found, though, was that most people were just using Bagnon as before -- as a single window display for your inventory.
So I canceled the project and reverted to a simpler form of Bagnon.

Bits of vBagnon can still be found in [LibItemSearch](https://github.com/Tuller/LibItemSearch-1.0) and [Combuctor](https://github.com/tullamods/Combuctor).
